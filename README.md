<h1>100 Days of Python</h1>

I am challenging myself to complete Angela Yu's "100 Days of Python" online course to prove to myself that I can learn a programming language to fluency. In my life, I have always struggled with breaking through plateaus, but through consistent, sustained effort, I believe that any plateau can be broken. I started this challenge on March 30th, 2024, and should complete the challenge on July 8th, 2024.
