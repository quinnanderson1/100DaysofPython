<h1>Day 2</h1>
The goal of today's project was to create a tip calculator taking into account the total, percent tip, and number of people paying. I achieved this by storing several user inputs in variables for the total, tip, and number of people, and then calculating the total in a seperate variable. I then rounded and printed this number using an f-string. The key to this project is understanding data types, namely float vs integer. You can't have half a person!
