<h1>Day 5</h1>
The goal of today's project is to create a random password generator. There are two options to do this: (1) the easy way where you simply fetch random letters, numbers, and symbols, and put them all in the same order, and (2) where you fetch the characters and then assemble them in a truly random order. I opted for the harder path! The only difference between the easy way and the hard way is the random.shuffle() method to shuffle the list of stored characters. I had to do some googling to find this method, as I hadn't interacted with it before. I also completed several exercises including the popular "FizzBuzz" challenge. These were very rewarding and enjoyable projects!
