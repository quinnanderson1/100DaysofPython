<h1>Day 6</h1>
The goal of today's project was to solve Reeborg's challenges using while loops and functions! This environment has a number of pre-configured functions, as you can see in the screenshots. There were three main challenges that I completed. Two of the challenges had to do with writing loops to jump over hurdles, the first of a fixed size and number and the second of variable size and number. The third was to write an algorithm to escape a maze that Reeborg is randomly placed in. This last challenge was truly a test, however, it was the most rewarding. I seriously had to close my eyes and envision how I would step through a maze using the right-edge logic. Being able to translate real-life ideas into programming is incredibly motivating and exciting, and I can't wait for the next challenges!
