<h1>Day 4</h1>
The goal of today's project is to create a rock-paper-scissors game with ASCII art. I also took on four additional challenges in the form of a coin flipper, a banker roulette game, and two variations of a treasure map program (one with a fixed size and one with a variable size). The variable-sized treasure map program was definitely the highlight of the day, and while it wasn't required by the course, I wanted to challenge myself!
