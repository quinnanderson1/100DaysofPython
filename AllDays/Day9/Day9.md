<h1>Day 9 - Silent Auction</h1>
The goal of today's project was to create a silent auction program that stores key:value pairs in a dictionary until bidding concluded, after which would find the highest bidder. The screen is supposed to clear after each entry, however this function is not one that I've learned (further explanation is in the comments for the project). I went to a concert today and was out of the house until almost 1am, but I was looking forward to coding all day despite being exhausted. I mean seriously, I'm not finishing writing this readme until 2:30am! This was a fun program that challenges you to think about how exactly to query dictionaries. As with lists, dictionaries have their own little quirks that make them fun, yet challenging, to work with. I'm sure in time my dictionary fluency will build. But until then, I've got tomorrow to look forward to!
