<h1>Day 7</h1>
The goal of today's project was to create a hangman game in the command-line! While this project was a challenge, it was by no means out of reach for what I've learned about Python and programming so far. While I was working, I found it helpful to (1) make a separate module for the wordlist and (2) make comments and segment to program so I can keep the functionality straight. While programming this game, much of what I was doing felt very intuitive and the syntax came easily; I'm actually starting to notice a difference in my ability/fluency to program with Python! As always, I'm looking forward to what more challenges there are to come!
