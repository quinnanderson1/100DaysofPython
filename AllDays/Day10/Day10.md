<h1>Day 10 - 4-Function Calculator</h1>
The goal of today's project was to create a four-function calculator. This was a pretty fun project where I got to practice making functions with parameters, error handling, and generally got practice working with functions that have outputs. I'm starting to see the value of functions, honestly. As programs grow and expand, and certain repeatable operations need to be called in different areas, having one, distinct function to do the job is invaluable. I always knew I'd end up having to make a calculator, and I'm glad today was that day!
