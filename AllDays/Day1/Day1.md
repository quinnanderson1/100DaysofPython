<h1>Day 1 - Band Name Generator</h1>
The goal of today's project was to create a band name generator based on someone's town and pet. I achieved this through printing the questions to the screen with the print() function and then storing user input inside of variables with str(input()). I used an f-string to write the final, formatted output to the screen.
