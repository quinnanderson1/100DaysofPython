<h1>Day 8 - Caesar Cipher</h1>
The goal of today's project was to create a program that encodes and decodes text to/from a Caesar (shift) cipher. This is one of the first programs I've written that only exits the program if the user says to, thus giving it the ability to run more than once without having to re-execute the file. I also did quite a bit of error handling (see screenshots). There was one problem I've not figured out yet, though, and that's how to continue asking for a valid input in the event a variable is not an integer...but that's a problem for another day. As of now, the users get two chances to enter a valid shift number. Any more attempts will lead to the program exiting due to an error. That's a problem for my backlog! This was a very fun project, and I can't wait for tomorrow's!
